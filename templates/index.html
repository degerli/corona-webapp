<body>
This web application is based on a novel deep learning architecture which is a combination of CovNets and Depthwise separable CovNets, trained to recognise Corona Virus from chest x-ray images. The neural network achieved accuracy exceeding 98% on the relevant test set. Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Therefore the model has limitations and cannot be used for definite clinical predictions! Instead it can be used for research and comparison purposes (please see notes below).

NOTES
<ul>
<li>This deep learning model has been trained and validated, using the following dataset: <a href="https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset">COVID-19 image data collection</a></li>
<li><b style="color:red;">The suitability of this deep learning model for clinical use has not been validated. Therefore it cannot be used for any clinical purpose! It can be used for research purposes and for comparison with other similar models.</b></li>
