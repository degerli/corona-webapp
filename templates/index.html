<body>
<p>This web application is based on a novel deep learning architecture which is a combination of CovNets and Depthwise separable CovNets, trained to recognise Corona Virus from chest x-ray images. We are constantly working to increase its accuracy and robustness with proper validation.</p> 
<p><font color="red">Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data and there is a very scarce availability of COVID 19 affected chest x ray images. Therefore the model has limitations and cannot be used for definite clinical predictions! Instead it can be used for research and comparison purposes.</font></p> 
<p>But we are constantly updating images dataset available on github as per the initiative of this git hub repo<a href="https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset">iee8023 repo</a>we are retraining our model with the availability of images to make it as accurate as possible and in the next phase we will be adding a functionality to classify COVID 19, SARS, Bacterial infections and Normal cases.</p>

<strong>Myth Buster !!!</strong><br>
Following are some common myths spreading about novel corona virus. Be aware of these following myths:
<ul>
<li><b>Wearing the mask will protect from the virus</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Masks are for people infected with the virus,not for a healthy individual.</li>
<li><b>The virus only affects older people</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a half truth. It effects everybody, even children. Though, older and sick people more likely to have a severe disease as compared to a healthy person.</li>
<li><b>The virus is only spreading in colder weather countries</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true. It can spread in any type of climate. Relatively warmer south east asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Phillipines recorded highest rate of infection so far. </li>
<li><b>Corona Virus is the most dangerous virus</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a plethora of different kinds of viruses out there in the world, which is more deadlier than COVID-19.Coronavirus is a fatal disease, but not every person who gets infected with this virus dies. Several people have been cured until now. As per the scientists, coronavirus is a mild type of virus infection with only 2 per cent fatality rate.</li>
<li><b>Rinsing your mouth with salt water can cure coronavirus.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is medically inaccurate as the Wuhan Union Hospital and Academician Zhongâ€™s team has officially refuted the rumour that saline water can help in treating the Corona virus. Additionally, the World Health Organization has also stated that there is no evidence to suggest that rinsing the mouth with saline solution is effective in preventing infection.</li>
